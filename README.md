# inverse_graphics_neural_network
An Inverse graphics neural network implementation. For more details, see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03167v4.pdf

The project is designed to study the processes occurring within convolutional neural networks

The project allows you to create an autocoder, consisting of convolutional and inverse of them Deconvolutional layers
